/*  DHT22/11 temerature and humidity sensor demonstration sketch
 *
 * This sketch reads the temperature and humidity from a DHT sensor.
 *
 * This is a common digital sensor which is calibrated in factory
 * and outputs true values so that no further calculations are needed
 * on the Arduino.

 *
 * This sketch was adapted for Arduino Step by Step by Peter Dalmaris from the
 * demo sketch that ships with the Adafruit library.
 *
 * Components
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - A DHT22 or DHT11 sensor
 *  - 10 kOhm resistor to pull up the data pin
 *
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------

### 95. An introduction to the Thermistor<a id="95"></a>

#### How to check if thermistor is NTC or PTC

<img src="assets/images/4.png" width="700">

- Set multimeter to check resistance connect with two terminal of thermistor
- now put finger around thermistor and check resistance
- case1: if resistance drop from room temp then NTC
- case2: if resistance increase from room temp then PTC
- The thermistor is an analog sensor, its resistance changes as temperature changes

- Wiki Thermistor concept [click me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor)

Note-

- Most of the sensor work on measuring resistance they all are transducer that change physical value to electrical value
- Means if i could create a device that change resistance depending of external changes like temperature, humidity, CO2, etc then i can apply ADC converter a formula to get correct reading

<img src="assets/images/19.png" width="700">

<img src="assets/images/20.png" width="700">

- We are using 3.3v supply for temp sensor because the 3.3v has its on voltage regulator and filter capacitor on arduino board which provide smooth signal
- As we draw voltage from laptop to arduino board that voltage is moving to other traces and same voltage we use to sensor, the signal has noise
- But whenever we use 3.3 voltage for sensor we have to tell arduino that we are using 3.3v pin to do that we use jumper wire to connect pin Aref(analog reference)
- If we wont connect aref pin using jumper wire in 3.3v volt the arduino max voltage changes to 3.3v but ADC have value from 0-600 sample instead of 0-1023

/*  Temperature MCP9808 sensor demo sketch
 *
 * This sketch reads the temperature from the MCP9808 precision sensor
 * on the Adafruit TCS34725 (or equivelant) breakout module.
 *
 * This sketch was adapted from the original that comes with the
 * Adafruit library for Arduino Step by Step by Peter Dalmaris.
 *
 * Components
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - Adafruit MCP9808 breakout module (or equivelant)
 *
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------
 *  - Wire
 *  - Adafruit_MCP9808
 *
 * Connections
 * -----------
 *  Break out    |    Arduino Uno
 *  -----------------------------
 *      VIN      |      5V
 *      GND      |      GND
 *      SCL      |      SCL or A5
 *      SDA      |      SDA or A4

 *
 * Other information
 * -----------------
 *  There are three pads on the sensor breakout that can be used
 *  to change the I2C address.

#### How to get scan address of any I2C device

```ino
// --------------------------------------
// i2c_scanner
//
// Version 1
//    This program (or code that looks like it)
//    can be found in many places.
//    For example on the Arduino.cc forum.
//    The original author is not know.
// Version 2, Juni 2012, Using Arduino 1.0.1
//     Adapted to be as simple as possible by Arduino.cc user Krodal
// Version 3, Feb 26  2013
//    V3 by louarnold
// Version 4, March 3, 2013, Using Arduino 1.0.3
//    by Arduino.cc user Krodal.
//    Changes by louarnold removed.
//    Scanning addresses changed from 0...127 to 1...119,
//    according to the i2c scanner by Nick Gammon
//    http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=10896
// Version 5, March 28, 2013
//    As version 4, but address scans now to 127.
//    A sensor seems to use address 120.
// Version 6, November 27, 2015.
//    Added waiting for the Leonardo serial communication.
//
//
// This sketch tests the standard 7-bit addresses
// Devices with higher bit address might not be seen properly.
