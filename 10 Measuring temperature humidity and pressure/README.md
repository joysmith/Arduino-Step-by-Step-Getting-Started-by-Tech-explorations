/*  DHT22/11 temerature and humidity sensor demonstration sketch
 *
 * This sketch reads the temperature and humidity from a DHT sensor.
 *
 * This is a common digital sensor which is calibrated in factory
 * and outputs true values so that no further calculations are needed
 * on the Arduino.

 *
 * This sketch was adapted for Arduino Step by Step by Peter Dalmaris from the
 * demo sketch that ships with the Adafruit library.
 *
 * Components
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - A DHT22 or DHT11 sensor
 *  - 10 kOhm resistor to pull up the data pin
 *
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------

### 95. An introduction to the Thermistor<a id="95"></a>

#### How to check if thermistor is NTC or PTC

<img src="assets/images/4.png" width="700">

- Set multimeter to check resistance connect with two terminal of thermistor
- now put finger around thermistor and check resistance
- case1: if resistance drop from room temp then NTC
- case2: if resistance increase from room temp then PTC
- The thermistor is an analog sensor, its resistance changes as temperature changes

- Wiki Thermistor concept [click me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor)

Note-

- Most of the sensor work on measuring resistance they all are transducer that change physical value to electrical value
- Means if i could create a device that change resistance depending of external changes like temperature, humidity, CO2, etc then i can apply ADC converter a formula to get correct reading

<img src="assets/images/19.png" width="700">

<img src="assets/images/20.png" width="700">

- We are using 3.3v supply for temp sensor because the 3.3v has its on voltage regulator and filter capacitor on arduino board which provide smooth signal
- As we draw voltage from laptop to arduino board that voltage is moving to other traces and same voltage we use to sensor, the signal has noise
- But whenever we use 3.3 voltage for sensor we have to tell arduino that we are using 3.3v pin to do that we use jumper wire to connect pin Aref(analog reference)
- If we wont connect aref pin using jumper wire in 3.3v volt the arduino max voltage changes to 3.3v but ADC have value from 0-600 sample instead of 0-1023

 *
 * ORIGINAL HEADER from the Sparkfun library
 *
 * This sketch shows how to use the SFE_BMP180 library to read the
 * Bosch BMP180 barometric pressure sensor.
 * https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11824
 *
 * Like most pressure sensors, the BMP180 measures absolute pressure.
 * This is the actual ambient pressure seen by the device, which will
 * vary with both altitude and weather.
 *
 * Before taking a pressure reading you must take a temparture reading.
 * This is done with startTemperature() and getTemperature().
 * The result is in degrees C.
 *
 * Once you have a temperature reading, you can take a pressure reading.
 * This is done with startPressure() and getPressure().
 * The result is in millibar (mb) aka hectopascals (hPa).
 *
 * If you'll be monitoring weather patterns, you will probably want to
 * remove the effects of altitude. This will produce readings that can
 * be compared to the published pressure readings from other locations.
 * To do this, use the sealevel() function. You will need to provide
 * the known altitude at which the pressure was measured.
 *
 * If you want to measure altitude, you will need to know the pressure
 * at a baseline altitude. This can be average sealevel pressure, or
 * a previous pressure reading at your altitude, in which case
 * subsequent altitude readings will be + or - the initial baseline.
 * This is done with the altitude() function.
 *
 * Hardware connections:
 *
 * - (GND) to GND
 * + (VDD) to 3.3V or 5V
 *
 * (WARNING: do not connect + to 5V or the sensor will be damaged!)
 *
 * You will also need to connect the I2C pins (SCL and SDA) to your
 * Arduino. The pins are different on different Arduinos:
 *
 * Any Arduino pins labeled:  SDA  SCL
 * Uno, Redboard, Pro:        A4   A5
 * Mega2560, Due:             20   21
 * Leonardo:                   2    3
 *
 * Leave the IO (VDDIO) pin unconnected. This pin is for connecting
 * the BMP180 to systems with lower logic levels such as 1.8V
 *
 * Have fun! -Your friends at SparkFun.
 *
 * The SFE_BMP180 library uses floating-point equations developed by the
 * Weather Station Data Logger project: http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/
 *
 * Our example code uses the "beerware" license. You can do anything
 * you like with this code. No really, anything. If you find it useful,
 * buy me a beer someday.
